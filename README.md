# Aceup Tech Assessment

This repository contains two projects:
- **frontend/**: React 19 + Vite application
- **backend/**: Ruby on Rails 7.2 API-only application (Ruby 3.2)

All services run in Docker using `docker-compose`.

## Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

## Quick Start

1. **Build and start all services:**

```bash
make build
```

2. **Access the apps:**
- Frontend: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
- Backend (Rails API): [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

3. **Database**
- Postgres runs in the `db` service.
- Default credentials (see `docker-compose.yml`):
  - Host: `db`
  - Username: `postgres`
  - Password: `postgres`
  - Database: `aceup_db`

4. **First-time Rails setup** (run in another terminal):

```bash
make db.init
```

## Useful Commands

- **Rebuild images after dependency changes:**
  ```bash
  make build
  ```

- **Start the services:**
  ```bash
  make start
  ```

- **Stop all services:**
  ```bash
  make stop
  ```

- **Go into rails console:**
  ```bash
  make rails.c
  ```

- **Go into bash console:**
  ```bash
  make sh
  ```

- **Run migrations:**
  ```bash
  make db.migrate
  ```

## Exercise for FullStack position

  Following the MVCS pattern (Model, View, Controller, Service), create a very simple order management system.

  **Frontend**

  - Create a Dashboard with at least 1 stat (# of orders created)
  - Create an order table | New Order button | New Order dialog
  - Refresh orders after new is created

  **Backend**

  - Orders crud
  - Send an email after order is created

## Exercise for Backend position; Unified People Sync (CRM + HRM)

## Overview

In this exercise, you will build a small **Ruby on Rails API** that ingests “Person” records coming from two external systems:

- **CRM** (e.g. sales/customer system)
- **HRM** (e.g. human resources system)

Each system has its own payload structure and is considered an external source of truth for different fields.

Your goal is to **normalize, merge, and persist people data** into a single internal representation while keeping the system clean, scalable, and performant.

This exercise is intentionally scoped to be completed in **4–5 hours**.

---

## Goals of the Exercise

We are primarily evaluating:

- Clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Sound object-oriented design and SOLID principles
- Appropriate use of design patterns
- Data modeling and database constraints
- Performance and scalability considerations
- Test quality and coverage
- Ability to explain trade-offs and future improvements

---

## Domain Description

### External Systems

You will receive people data from two sources:

#### 1. CRM
- Represents prospects or customers
- Example attributes:
  - `external_id`
  - `email`
  - `first_name`
  - `last_name`
  - `phone`
  - `company`
  - `updated_at`

#### 2. HRM
- Represents employees
- Example attributes:
  - `external_id`
  - `email`
  - `first_name`
  - `last_name`
  - `job_title`
  - `department`
  - `manager_email`
  - `start_date`
  - `updated_at`

Payload shapes may differ between systems.

You may define reasonable example payloads yourself.

---

## Internal Model

Your application should maintain a unified internal **Person** record.

A Person:
- Can be sourced from CRM, HRM, or both
- Should be **deduplicated**
- Should support **partial updates** from either system
- Must preserve source-specific identifiers

You are free to design the schema, but you should consider:
- How people are uniquely identified
- How external IDs are stored
- How conflicts between systems are resolved
- Which fields should be indexed

---

## Source of Truth Rules

When the same person exists in both systems, resolve conflicts using the following rules:

- **HRM is the source of truth for:**
  - `job_title`
  - `department`
  - `manager`
  - `start_date`

- **CRM is the source of truth for:**
  - `email`
  - `phone`
  - `company`

- Shared fields (`first_name`, `last_name`) may come from either system, but your logic should be consistent and deterministic.

---

## Functional Requirements

### Ingest Endpoints

Implement the following endpoints:

- `POST /ingest/crm/people`
- `POST /ingest/hrm/people`

Each endpoint:
- Accepts JSON payloads (single record or batch)
- Normalizes incoming data
- Creates or updates the corresponding Person
- Is **idempotent** (re-sending the same data must not create duplicates)

### Query Endpoints

Implement:

- `GET /people`
  - Supports filtering by:
    - email
    - source (crm, hrm)
    - department
  - Supports pagination

- `GET /people/:id`

---

## Technical Requirements

- Ruby on Rails
- Postgres as the database
- JSON or JSONB is allowed where appropriate
- Use database constraints and indexes to enforce integrity
- Controllers should be thin; business logic should live outside controllers
- The system should be designed so adding a **new data source** would require minimal changes

---

## Testing Requirements

- Include automated tests
- At minimum:
  - Unit tests for normalization / merge logic
  - One request spec per ingest endpoint
- Tests should be clear and meaningful rather than exhaustive

---

## Documentation

Include a `README` section explaining:

- Your overall approach and architecture
- Key design decisions
- How deduplication works
- How conflict resolution is implemented
- Performance and scalability considerations
- What you would improve or extend with more time

---

## Non-Requirements

- No authentication required
- No UI required
- No background jobs required (you may stub or describe them if relevant)
- No real external API calls

---

## Evaluation Notes

We value:
- Simplicity over over-engineering
- Clear boundaries and responsibilities
- Thoughtful trade-offs explained in writing
- Code that another engineer could confidently extend

Good luck, and feel free to make reasonable assumptions where needed.

## Notes from candidate

Hello, thanks for checking my repository. Although the assessment for the fullstack position was simple, I have made the following assumptions:
- An initial set of products is needed in the seed
- There needs to be a way of editing or adding products
- There needs to be a way of editing an order(at least its customer name, email or status)

### What I did

- **Dashboard** with order count stat
- **Orders table** showing all orders with their items, totals, status, etc
- **New Order dialog** where you pick products and quantities, it creates the order and refreshes the list
- **Edit Order dialog** for changing customer name, email or status
- **Products tab** with a simple table and dialog to add/edit/delete products
- **Order statuses** (pending, confirmed, shipped, delivered, cancelled) with a default of pending
- **Validations** on both backend and frontend, like no duplicate products in an order
- **Total price** gets calculated automatically from the order items
- **Email confirmation** is set up with action mailer but using test delivery since I don't have a real mail server for this. The mailer, template and service are all there though
- **Unit tests** with rspec for the orders endpoint and the order service

### How it works

The backend follows MVCS. The Order Service handles creation logic and triggers the confirmation email. Orders have many order items which belong to products. The frontend is plain React with basic css, no extra libraries. I've had the help of AI for the front end, it has been flagged in the commit messages for transparency.

For emails I went with the action mailer test delivery method. The mailer and template are fully implemented, just not connected to a real smtp server. In a real project I would use a service like send grid.

### Running tests

I've set up a separate test database (`aceup_db_test`) so running tests doesn't wipe out development data. To run them:

```bash
# first time setup
docker-compose run -e RAILS_ENV=test backend bash -c "rails db:create db:migrate"

# run tests
docker-compose run -e RAILS_ENV=test backend bundle exec rspec
```

### What I'd improve with more time

- Pagination for orders and products
- Better error messages shown to the user
- Loading states and spinners
- Order search or filters
- Maybe use something like tailwind instead of plain CSS
